# Talks and Presentations I've given

This repository contains slides from various technical talks I've given over the years. This collection covers a range of topics in software development and technology.

Caveat: The slides are not exhaustive and are meant to be used as a reference. They are not a substitute for a full-length course or tutorial. They also represent work done while I employed at various companies (Craftwork, Google, Stripe, Gymnasium, Smpl, Microsoft) -- but are not endorsed by those companies.

### [OSS for Startup and Career](./00-oss-for-startup-and-career.iapresenter/oss-charlotte-for-startup-and-career.pdf)

This is a talk I gave at the first Open Source Charlotte Meetup, in the fall of 2022. It covers the power of open source software for launching your startup and advancing your career.

### [Automate your Saas Product's Crisis Response Process](./01-automate-your-saas-products-crisis-response-process/)

This presentation was created while I was applying for DevRel jobs at Google in 2020. It landed me a gig running the Google Assistant DevRel team - and though the advice may be a bit out of date by now, the principles are still sound.
