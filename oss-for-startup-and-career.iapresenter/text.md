# 

Enough about me, let's talk about why we're here today - I want to talk about Open Source, and how you can use it to build momentum for your career, or launch a company, or build a product

If there's exactly one thing I want you to get out of today's talk, it's this:

start with something you know
Add on to it (one thing at a time if you can)
Dig yourself out of holes when you can
Find help when you can't

# Wanna build a product?
#### Sure you do.
Some recommendations for enterprising open sorcerers
---
## Opportunity recognition
	- Find an enthusiastic niche 
	- Immerse yourself
	- Look for repeated pain / learning
	
	_...and see where you can **add value** through perspective, tooling, or automation_
---
## Tips for integrating new tools & APIs
	- Try the product
	- Test the community
	- Build relationships
	- Ask about OSS tiers 

---

## Teach yourself to learn
	- Github
	- YouTube / TikTok 
	- Blogs
	- Dev / Hashnode / Medium

StackOverflow notably absent - I rarely learn from there

---

## Take note:
	- What did you learn?
	- What do you keep looking up?
	- Where did your experience deviate?
	- Where can you offer perspective?
